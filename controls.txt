Ratpack 2015 Controls

Pilot:
Mecanum drive: left stick forward and strafe, right stick x-axis rotation. This has acceleration control applied at all times

Slow down: pressing down either of the top two bumpers will halve the drive inputs, allowing for greater precision

Brake: pressing down (or up) on *both* sticks will immediately stop the robot (overriding acceleration control).
This is intended to be used if the robot is about to crash, not as a usual part of driving.

Copilot:
Pick up a bin: press B. this will lower the lift, run the rollers until a bin 
breaks the line break, then lift up the bin.

Pick up a tote: press A. this will run the rollers until a tote breaks the line break,
then lower the lift, and raise it up again, picking up the tote

Eject from the rollers: press Y (will run until cancelled)

Cancel/stop any of the previous three: press X or jiggle the left-stick. if the button is
pressed again, the sequence will restart from the beginning.

Note: once the robot is in a certain mode (eg "picking up a tote"), pressing the same button again will have no effect.
If you want to restart the sequence, cancel it then start again.

(Note that all sequences are mutually exclusive, so for example pressing A will cancel the 'B'-sequence and start from the beginning)
