Pick up a bin: press B. this will lower the lift, run the rollers until a bin 
breaks the line break, then lift up the bin.

Pick up a tote: press A. this will run the rollers until a tote breaks the line break,
then lower the lift, and raise it up again, picking up the tote

Eject from the rollers: press Y (will run until cancelled)

Cancel/stop any of the previous three: press X or jiggle the left-stick. if the button is
pressed again, the sequence will restart from the beginning.

(Note that all sequences are mutually exclusive, so for example pressing A will cancel the 'B'-sequence and start from the beginning)
